# Football Match Analysis & Prediction System

## Overview
A sophisticated web application that combines statistical analysis with AI to provide comprehensive football match predictions. The system uses public APIs, mathematical models, and AI assistance to analyze matches and provide insights across various betting markets.

## Features
- Real-time match data fetching
- Statistical analysis of team performance
- AI-powered match insights using Microsoft's Phi-3 Mini model
- Comprehensive dashboard displaying predictions
- Historical data analysis
- Multiple betting market predictions

## Technologies Used
- React with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- football-data.org API for match data
- OpenRouter API for AI analysis (using Microsoft's Phi-3 Mini model)
- Axios for API calls

## Current Issues & Need Assistance

### API Integration Issues
1. Error fetching upcoming matches from football-data.org API
   - Need help with proper error handling
   - API response structure verification needed
   - Rate limiting considerations

### Data Processing Challenges
1. Historical data processing and storage
   - Efficient data fetching strategies needed
   - Caching implementation required
   - Performance optimization for large datasets

### AI Integration Needs
1. Optimizing prompts for the Phi-3 Mini model
2. Improving AI response parsing
3. Handling API limits effectively

### UI/UX Improvements Needed
1. Better loading states
2. Error message display improvements
3. Mobile responsiveness enhancements

## API Keys Required
```javascript
Football-data.org API Key: use your own API
OpenRouter API Key: use your own API
```
